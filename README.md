# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
This project is  a machine  learning task. he task here is to correctly classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 


The study of handwritten digits character recognition, also known as optical character
recognition (OCR), is important for several reasons including document digitization, form
processing, banking and finance, handwritten-based user authentication and so on. The task
here is to correctly classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset using Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). The dataset can be found at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
Based on this task, consider the following questions:
a) How did the use of different regularisation methods affect the performance of your
CNN model?
b) Report how changes to the number of convolution blocks affect the performance of
your model quantitatively?
c) What is the effect of varying learning rates on the performance of the CNN algorithm.
d) Was there a case of overfitting observed in your model at any point ? Explain.
